## House Price Prediction (Regression) üè†

**Project Objective:** To build a regression model that accurately predicts the sale price of houses based on a large number of features. This project will cover the complete machine learning workflow, from deep EDA to advanced preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

The model is trained on a supervised learning ML model

In this project, I successfully built an end-to-end regression pipeline to predict house prices.

### Key Steps Undertaken:

* Analyzed and transformed the target variable (SalePrice) to handle its skewness.
* Conducted a thorough EDA to understand the key features influencing price.
* Implemented a robust preprocessing strategy, handling various types of missing data and encoding categorical features correctly.
* Engineered new features (TotalSF, TotalBath, Age) that provided more predictive power.
* Trained and compared multiple models, demonstrating the superior performance of XGBoost over a simple linear model, Decision Tree and SVM.
* Evaluated the models using standard regression metrics and generated a final Output file.

### Potential Next Steps:

* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use techniques like GridSearchCV to find the optimal parameters for the XGBoost model.
* **More Feature Engineering:** Create more complex features, such as interaction terms between key variables.
* **Ensemble Modeling:** Combine the predictions of several different models to potentially achieve even better results.

The dataset is pulled from one of the ***kaggle*** competition which has a large number of features

* SalePrice - the property's sale price in dollars. This is the target variable that we're trying to predict.
